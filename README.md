# EmailApp
Welcome to my first project. 
The concept behind my project, EmailApp1, was to act as an IT Support Administrator responsible for creating email accounts for new hires.


This application does the following:
Generates an email with the following syntax: firstname.lastname@department.company.com
Determines the department by allowing users to input their department
Generates a random String for a password
Uses methods to change the password, set the maibox capacity, and define an alternate email address
Lastly,the app has get methods to display the name, email, and mailbox capacity
